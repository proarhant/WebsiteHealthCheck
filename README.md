# Website Health Check
This Python-based web application monitors website health by scanning for key client-side issues. The current version evaluates page loading status, detects JavaScript errors, captures network request failures, and logs console output problems to provide a comprehensive view of a site's health.

## Additional Client-Side Features in Development:

I am currently enhancing the application with additional capabilities to provide more comprehensive client-side monitoring, including the following:

<code>Broken Link Detection</code> – Identify and report dead or unreachable hyperlinks across the site.

<code>Resource Load Performance</code> – Monitor load times for images, scripts, and other assets to flag slow-loading components.

<code>Responsive Design Validation</code> – Check layout adaptability across various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

<code>Third-Party Script Monitoring</code> – Detect failures or timeouts from external scripts such as analytics or ad providers.

<code>Security Warnings Detection</code> – Identify mixed content issues, invalid SSL certificates, and other browser security warnings.

<code>Accessibility Compliance Checks</code> – Analyze pages for common accessibility issues to support WCAG standards.

<code>Client-Side Storage Validation</code> – Monitor usage and availability of cookies and local/session storage.

<code>DOM Exception Tracking</code> – Capture and report runtime exceptions triggered by DOM interactions.
